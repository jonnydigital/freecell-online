# Content Humanizer Skill

Make content sound natural and human-written. Remove AI tells.

## Rules

### CRITICAL: No em dashes (—)
- NEVER use em dashes
- Replace with commas, periods, or rephrase

| Don't Write | Do Write |
|-------------|----------|
| FreeCell — unlike other games — is... | FreeCell, unlike other games, is... |
| all 52 cards — making it a game of skill | all 52 cards. That makes it a game of skill. |
| the four spaces — called free cells — that | the four spaces (called free cells) that |

### No AI Slop Phrases
Remove or rephrase these dead giveaways:
- "In today's world..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "This means that..."
- "Whether you're a beginner or an expert..."
- "In this comprehensive guide..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "This is what makes [X] so [Y]"
- "Here's the thing:"
- "At its core..."
- "The beauty of..."
- "That said..."
- "This ensures that..."
- "It's worth noting..."

### Writing Style
- Grade 8 reading level
- Use contractions (it's, don't, you'll, that's)
- Short sentences. Mix lengths. Some fragments are fine.
- Active voice over passive
- "You" and "your" over "one" or "the player"
- Specific over vague ("99.999% of deals" not "nearly all deals")
- Bold key info for scanners
- Sound like a knowledgeable friend explaining, not a textbook

### Tone for FreeCell Content
- Casual authority — you know this game inside out
- Slightly conversational but not forced
- Enthusiasm is fine, hype is not
- Respect the reader's intelligence
- No exclamation marks in body text (headers OK sparingly)
