# Card Assets Decision

*Date: 2026-02-23*

## Decision: SVG-Cards (Open Source)

**Source**: https://github.com/htdebeer/SVG-cards
**License**: LGPL-2.1 (permissive for use as assets)
**Format**: PNG (2x resolution) — 52 faces + 1 back

## Rationale
- Free, open-source, immediately available
- Clean, classic card design
- Good enough for MVP — doesn't block development
- Will commission custom card designs for Phase 3 (premium skins)

## Future
- Commission custom designs: modern, premium feel
- Multiple card back designs for customization
- Animated card faces for special editions
