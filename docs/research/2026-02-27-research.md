## Tier 2 Competitor Scan (Friday Rotation)

### 1. Solitaire Bliss (solitairebliss.com/freecell)
**Status**: Active, strong content game

**What they do well:**
- ✨ **SPARK: Video tutorial link on game page** — YouTube embed for "how to play FreeCell." This is huge for SEO (dwell time, rich snippets) and user onboarding. We have ZERO video content.
- Customizable appearance (backgrounds, card backs) — settings via gear icon
- Deep strategy section with internal links to dedicated strategy page (`/freecell-strategy`)
- Dedicated rules page (`/how-to-play-freecell`) — separate URL = separate ranking opportunity
- Content depth: ~2000+ words on game page covering objective, setup, how-to-play, strategy
- Cross-links to related games (Spider, Klondike) from every page

**What they're missing:**
- No daily challenge visible in content
- No competitive/social features
- No numbered games for shareability
- Content feels template-y — same structure across all game pages

**SEO Takeaway:** Their content-first approach works. They rank for informational queries ("how to play freecell", "freecell strategy") which feed into their game pages. We need to match this depth.

### 2. Green Felt (greenfelt.net/freecell)
**Status**: Active, community-focused

**What they do well:**
- ✨ **SPARK: Community + forum integration** — They have a forum with feature requests. Creates user investment and loyalty. Community-driven roadmap.
- ✨ **SPARK: Historical FreeCell narrative** — Their game page includes the full history (Baker's Game → Paul Alfille → PLATO → Jim Horne → Windows). This is unique content that competitors don't have.
- Clean, no-frills approach — game loads fast, rules are clear
- Blog for updates — transparency builds trust
- "Innovative game-play features" messaging — implies they're iterating

**What they're missing:**
- Very sparse content compared to Solitaire Bliss
- No customization options visible
- No mobile app upsell
- Old-school design aesthetic

**SEO Takeaway:** The historical content angle is untapped. A "History of FreeCell" page with proper sourcing could rank for informational queries and earn educational backlinks.

### 3. Solitaire Paradise (solitaireparadise.com)
**Status**: Active, content-heavy

**What they do well:**
- ✨ **SPARK: Solitaire terminology glossary page** — Dedicated `/terminology.html` page. This is a classic SEO play: captures top-of-funnel "what is a tableau" queries and funnels to game pages.
- ✨ **SPARK: Game types/families classification page** — `/types-families.html` creates a taxonomy of 500+ solitaire variants. Massive internal linking opportunity.
- History page with citations (Lady Adelaide Cadogan, David Parlett)
- Strategy page dedicated to improving win rates
- Well-known games hub page for cross-linking

**What they're missing:**
- Dated design
- FreeCell page returned 404 on direct access — possible broken routing
- No evident gamification features

**SEO Takeaway:** The glossary/terminology page idea is brilliant. Low effort, high SEO value. Every term links back to relevant game pages. We should build one.

### 4. Solitr (solitr.com)
**Status**: Active, ultra-minimal

**What they do well:**
- Fastest load time of any competitor — nearly zero JS overhead
- Rules explained concisely right on the page
- Double-click to foundation (standard but executed cleanly)

**What they're missing:**
- Zero content depth — bad for SEO
- No customization, no stats, no social features
- No FreeCell variant (only Klondike visible)

**Not much to learn here** except that speed matters. Users who want zero friction exist.

## Synthesis: Key Findings

### Content Gaps We Can Fill
1. **Video content** — Solitaire Bliss has it, we don't. Even a simple screen-recorded tutorial would help.
2. **Terminology/glossary page** — Solitaire Paradise's approach. Build `/glossary` with terms linking to game + strategy pages.
3. **FreeCell history page** — Green Felt's historical narrative is unique. We should do it better with more depth + images.
4. **Game types taxonomy** — A "Types of Solitaire" page that classifies variants and links to our game.

### Feature Gaps
1. **Theme customization** — Solitaire Bliss has it, already in our backlog (HIGH priority)
2. **Community/forum** — Green Felt's model. Not immediate priority but worth planning.
3. **Numbered game URLs** — Already in backlog. Key for shareability AND SEO.

### SEO Strategy Updates
- Build content hub: game page → rules page → strategy page → history page → glossary → types taxonomy
- Each page targets different intent (transactional, informational, navigational)
- Internal linking between all content pages (Solitaire Bliss model)
- Schema markup: Game, FAQPage, HowTo structured data

## Reddit/Forum Research
**BLOCKED** — Search API unavailable. Defer to next cycle with working search.

## GA4 Analysis
**BLOCKED** — Browser unavailable. Need openclaw browser or Chrome relay to access GA4.

Priority for next session: Get GA4 data. This drives everything.
